# Introduction to Compiler Design

An Android app for curious people to learn a bit about compilers. The concepts that are introduced in this application are primarily sourced from "Compilers: Techniques, Principals and Tools," 2nd Ed. by Alfred V Aho, Monica S Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D Ullman.

Compiler design is a complex topic. This application is squarely aimed at a brief introduction to compiler design, it is not a replacement for a course at university on this subject.
## Brainstorming

#### Target User
Fellow computer science students who wish to learn more about
compiler design.

#### Type of information they need:
An overview of each of the front end parts of compiler design which includes
- Lexical Analysis
- Recognition
- Parsing
- Semantic Analysis
- Code Generation

## Rubrics

This app is an exercise in creating a first mobile application, with the aim of teaching the user 5 new things. Seeing as I have just completed an undergraduate course in compiler design that I really enjoyed, I thought I might share some of what I learned.
